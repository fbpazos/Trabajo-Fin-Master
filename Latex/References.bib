  abstract  = {We introduce a new class of generators of two types: add-with-carry and subtract-with-borrow. Related to lagged-Fibonacci generators, the new class has interesting underlying theory, astonishingly long periods and provable uniformity for full sequences. Among several that we mention, we recommend particularly promising ones that will generate a sequence of $2^{1751}$ bits, or a sequence of $2^{1376}$ 32-bit integers, or a sequence of $2^{931}$ reals with 24-bit fractions--all using simple computer arithmetic (subtraction) and a few memory locations.},

The book continues to be accessible and expertly guides readers through the many available techniques of numerical methods and analysis.An Introduction to Numerical Methods and Analysis, Second Edition reflects the latest trends in the field, includes new material and revised exercises, and offers a unique emphasis on applications. The author clearly explains how to both construct and evaluate approximations for accuracy and performance, which are key skills in a variety of fields. A wide range of higher-level methods and solutions, including new topics such as the roots of polynomials, spectral collocation, finite element ideas, and Clenshaw-Curtis quadrature, are presented from an introductory perspective, and the Second Edition also features:Chapters and sections that begin with basic, elementary material followed by gradual coverage of more advanced materialExercises ranging from simple hand computations to challenging derivations and minor proofs to programming exercisesWidespread exposure and utilization of MATLABAn appendix that contains proofs of various theorems and other materialThe book is an ideal textbook for students in advanced undergraduate mathematics and engineering courses who are interested in gaining an understanding of numerical methods and numerical analysis.}
