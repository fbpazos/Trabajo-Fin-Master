For a total of 5 years, I have been expanding my knowledge in Mathematics and Computer Science in higher levels of education, not only was my journey full of ups and downs but also with outstanding people that made these highs and lows worth every moment. 

To say 'thank you' would only be an understatement of my true appreciation to these people who have been with me and, I hope, will always be on this journey of enlightenment. To such an extent, I want to give all the credit to the ones that provided me with the chance to find new objectives in life, and who always pushed me to strive to be my best self in every aspect of life, that credit is in large part to both my Mother, Maria Pazos Arenal, and Father, Fernando Bellido Alonso-Carriazo as well as all the members of my family to whom I owe a large part of my very best moments.

I would like to extend my greatest and deep appreciation to my best colleagues who made me laugh even in the darkest of times, my outstanding music group at \textit{Sol Menor} that allowed me to express beyond the academic, see beyond reason by expressing and understanding music and teaching me about what team-work really means.

In addition, I want to express my most sincere thank you to my tutor Juan Manuel Pérez Pardo who has accompanied me through the development of this work as well as the teachers who once pushed me to strive towards the study of Science, those being Concha Elena Alegre, María Pilar Cuesta López, Aurora Insua Ruíz and my other fellow teachers and professors.
